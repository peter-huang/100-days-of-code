**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts:**
**_ - After completing Freecodecamp's Legacy Full-Stack certification, I've decided to better my knowledge of web development and found Udemy's Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2020 by Dr. Angela Yu. I"ll be restarting my refresher in HTML and CSS. _**
**_ - For my Quotes API Service, I'm working on rewriting my database module with Mongoose as well as setting up user registration/login with PassportJS. I"m having a bit of trouble getting the session to be saved and redirecting to the dashboard page after authentication. _**
